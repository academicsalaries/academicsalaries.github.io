                <h1 class="faq-page">What is the point of collecting academic salary data?</h1>
                <!-- faq answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>The goal is that through transparency we can build a better academic environment with increased and fairer pay. Often times, salary data is opaque, which can make it difficult to know if a salary being offered to you is fair. Data collected here may be used to give you insight into salary growth potential, identify salary trends, or may help you negotiate fairer pay on an offer.</p>

                <h1 class="faq-page">Should I go into academia or industry?</h1>
                <!-- faq answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>It really depends on your individual goals and preferences. Both academia and industry can offer rewarding careers and opportunities for personal and professional growth.</p>
                    
                    <p>Academia, which includes teaching and research at colleges and universities, can be a great choice for people who are passionate about a particular subject and want to share their knowledge with others. It can also provide opportunities for intellectual exploration and the freedom to pursue your own research interests.</p>
                    
                    <p>On the other hand, industry, which includes working for companies or organizations outside of academia, can be a great option for people who want to apply their knowledge and skills in a practical setting. It can also offer more stability, pay, and potential for advancement, as well as a wider range of job opportunities.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ultimately, the decision between academia and industry should be based on your own interests, goals, and values. It's important to carefully consider the pros and cons of each path and to talk to people who have experience in both fields to get a better sense of what each one has to offer.</p>
